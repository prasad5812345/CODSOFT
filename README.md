This repository contains three Python projects developed as part of my virtual internship with **Codsoft**. These projects demonstrate core Python programming skills, along with simple yet functional user interfaces.

## Projects

### 1. TO-DO LIST
A command-line based To-Do List that allows users to:
- Add new tasks.
- View all tasks.
- Remove completed tasks.

### 2. CALCULATOR

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Clear and reset functions.
- Stylish and user-friendly design.

### 3. Contact Book
A minimalistic contact book application that allows users to:
- Add, edit, and delete contacts.
- Search for contacts by name or phone number.
- Store contact information such as names, phone numbers, emails, and addresses.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (for Calculator)
- Any additional Python libraries mentioned within individual project files.

## Usage
To run any of the projects, navigate to the project folder and execute the main Python script:
```bash
python file_name.py
```

## About
These projects were developed during my virtual internship with **Codsoft**, where I focused on enhancing my Python programming skills through practical, real-world applications.
